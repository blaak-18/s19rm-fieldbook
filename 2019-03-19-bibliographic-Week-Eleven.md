### Annotated Bib Week Eleven

-

_**Jerome McGann, “The Textual Condition” (1991)**_:

While personally, I found this piece very difficult to follow and McGann's thoughts to be a little outdated, overall I think that this piece really gets at the idea of the instability of text. While this piece seems to be reflecting a sense of anxiety over hoe fleeting and instable text and form are, I think that as time has past and the internet has reached such high influence, the idea of "text" and "form" have already been disrupted and mutated in cyber spaces. Particularly, I might be reading this section incorrectly, but I found the section on digital books and how the McGann argues that those books can't be "read" and that they can hardly be called "books" to be slightly elitist and ableist. Since so much of what gets to be considered a book and what gets to be considered a text has long been determined by self-identifying cis-gendered white men, why is moving the idea of "text" to digital spaces and reclaiming that rigid definition to fit differenct types of people and bodies so wrong?

_**Sydney Shep, “‘Smiley, you’re on candid camera’: Emoticons & Pre-Digital Networks” (2010)**_:

First of all, I absolutely adore this piece. I really enjoy articles like this that really delve into how things that we believe are specific to our current moment in time are actually not. I think the thing that I thought the most while reading this article is that in today's time, when we use emoticons, its sort of a thoughtless gesture that takes half a second to produce in a document. However, in the nineteenth century, since the type would have been set by hand, you had to really *mean* that emoticon which I find very amusing. Particularly, thinking about the poem "The Dude" I can't imagine how much time must have gone into setting that poem into type, but whoever did it must have really wanted people to see the dude. 

_**Denis Tenen, “Computational Poetics: An Introduction” and “Metaphor Machines” from Plain Text: The Poetics of Computation (2018)**_:

The particular part of this article that I found interesting was this quote: "The initial effort it takes to inhabit a new cognitive environment discourages curiosity. Smart designers therefore rely on acculturated practice, the turning of pages in our case, to minimize adaptive friction. Digital poems, novels, physician’s scripts, and legal contracts resemble their paper counterparts in order to enable familiar actions" (39). What this quote made me think about is how so much of technology (besides ebooks) is trying to mimic some real life experience. For example, the "desktop" of your computer is supposed to mimic a real desktop which is why computers have "files" and "folders" and even a "recycling bin." so much of software design is investing in making software as easy to use as possible and that means coming as close as possible to capitalizing intuitive actions and decisions. Coincidentally, most intuitive actions are derived from some experience in real life that has taught us how to act appropriately. So, if you want someone to automatically know how to get rid of a file on a computer, you shape the "delete file" bucket like a recycling bin. If you want someone to be able to pick up a kindle and know how to use it, you mimic the layout and function of a printed page.

_**Michael Whitmore, “Text: A Massively Addressable Object,” from Debates in the Digital Humanities (2012)**_:

I really appreciated this quote from the article: "That doesn’t mean that they are immaterial, however. Human labor has transformed them from microfilm facsimiles of real pages into diplomatic quality digital transcripts, marked up in TEI so that different formatting features can be distinguished. That labor is as real as any other." I think that it is so  incredibly easy to take for granted the labor that goes into digitizing a text and making software available to the public. As Tenen discussed in his article, software development sort of depends on this illusion of a metaphor. Good software operates under this metaphor so effectively that the labor and works turning the cogs behind the scenes become invisible. However, its important to not forget that while it is true that digital experiences are often based in mimicking real life experiences, once something is created and digitized, it still has to be maintained to some degree by a human being working behind the scenes in order to ensure that our metaphor doesn't crumble apart.
