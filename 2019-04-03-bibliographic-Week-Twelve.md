### Annotated Bib Week Twelve

-

_**Roberto Busa, “Why Can a Computer Do So Little?” (1976)**_:

I think while reading this article, what I was most struck by, was thinking about how far natural language processing has come in only such a small amount of time. Thinking about how wide some of the gaps between printing technologies and reading technologies have been in the past, the gaps between this article and our processing ability today is so small. I really wonder why it is that progress has become such a rapid fire movement? The fact that computers can now read and understand thousands of texts all at once seems almost impossible and yet somehow, its happening. Now, with some of the progress that's been made in artificial intelligence, I wonder what the next progression in digital scholarship will be?

_**Benjamin M. Schmidt, “Do Humanists Need to Understand Algorithms?” from Debates in Digital Humanities 2016**_:

The topic of this article is something that I am very passionate about, personally. Before undergrad, I only really had interest in English and as I was applying for college, I started to learn about Digital Humanities as a field and decided that if I wanted to be able to use computers to ask books questions, I needed to understand how computers work, at all. That line of thinking is what led me to pursue an additional degree in computer science. I think that understanding algorithms is very important for anyone who works with the data that algorithms produce and I agree with most of the points in this article. However, I do want to push back on this quote: "What an algorithm does is distinct from, and more important to understand, than how it does it." I would argue that what an algorithm does is equally as important as how it does it. From a computational perspective, how an algorithm follows a given set of instructions can actually determine some pretty important factors such as how quickly an algorithm can run and whether it can run, at all. Computational expense is something that I have been explicitly taught, so maybe I'm a bit biased, but I think that part of really understanding an algorithm is also understanding how smart design can effect results just as much as any other factor.

_**Stephen Ramsay, “An Algorithmic Criticism” and “Potential Readings” from Reading Machines: Toward an Algorithmic Criticism**_:

What I found particularly interesting about this reading was its discussion of narrative control and chance. I think a really important aspect of digital work, is to allow yourself to explore different possibilities rather than going into a project with any sort of set result in mind. Just reading a text with a different perspective in mind can inform an entirely different kind of text or narrative than what conventional readings do. Thinking about this reading  in conjunction with the Busa, I'm again struck by how far digital scholarship has come in such a short amount of time and the complexity of inquiry that we are capable of now.


_**Annette Vee, “Introduction: Computer Programming as Literacy” from Coding Literacy: How Computer Programming is Changing Writing (2018)**_:

I really enjoyed this reading because it gets at some thoughts that I've had for quite some time. I think that we need to expand our definitions of "literacy" to include experience-based literacy and other forms of knowledge and access that don't include traditional methods of reading. I think a lot about how traditional definitions of literacy often exclude the labor and experiences of people who perhaps aren't literate in the sense that they can read words on paper particularly well, but are able to pick apart diagrams and images in ways that I believe can only be described as its own form of literacy. In today's age, with technology playing such a central role in our methods of communication, I think that understanding how computers work and how programming facilitates certain methods of communication is crucial. 

_**Lauren Klein, “The Carework and Codework of the Digital Humanities” (2015)**_:

I found Klein's discussion of codework and carework in digital humanities to be incredibly fascinating. Academically, I am very interested in carework as a gendered concept and thinking about how many pieces of evidence of the carework of women doesn't end up in archive, or if it doesn't, is relegated to a corner somewhere. I think that the concept that Klein is pointing to, that tools and interpretation should work together, is incredibly important to keep in mind in order to ensure that information regarding labor, and specifically gendered labor, isn't lost.
