### Annotated Bib Week Two

-

_**The End of Books by Octave Uzanne**_:

In this reading, many scholars are thinking about how the world will be centuries from now, including the physical continents, the political landscape, and most importantly, technology. The main argument made in this publication is that printing is at risk of dying due to the development of technologies that record sound. The narrator predicts that sound will soon become the primary medium that people use to exchange and receive information over the printed word. This reading seemed to be highly satirical to me because it is a written and printed story arguing against printing, but funnily enough, the narrator isn't entirely wrong. While print hasn't been entirely replaced by audio, it is the case that audiobooks, podcasts, voice recognition software, and other means of auditory knowledge production have become increasingly popular over time. However, I think that the piece does ignore the antiquity of oral histories, something that Amaranth Borsuk illustrates in *The Book*.



_**Format
Meredith L. McGill**_:

This reading focuses on format as a bibliographers' medium. The writers argue that book formatting draws our attention to the fact that reception of a book cannot be separated from the production of the book, itself. The writer's description of Franklin's failed reprinting of *Pamela* which forced him to focus on shorter texts reminded me of Borsuk's discussion of how reading and writing tools develop around human need. The writer's argument that a book's format is meant to go unnoticed but remain culturally and subconsciously significant, all the same, seems to almost contradict *The End of Books* which seems to be making the argument that format is completely insignificant since the narrator prophesizes that auditory recordings will replace physical books.



_**The Book as Object
Amaranth Borsuk**_:

This chapter explores the history of the book and writing. Borsuk argues that books don't change because of the needs of readers, but that types of writing (content) develop alongside the technologies that facilitate its distribution. Where *The End of Books* argues that technology will lead to a return to oratory and non-private reading experiences, Borsuk outlines how the trajectory of the written word has led it away from reading as a communal, public event dependent on a narrator and towards reading s a private experience. In particular, Borsuk's illustration of how writing and communication evolves in tandem with social and physical limitations and demands (for example, the Chinese writing system evolving around the physical limitations of the jiance they wrote on) seems to be echoing a similar point that McGill makes about Benjamin Franklin's decision to rely primarily on short printings after the failure of his reprinting of *Pamela*.



_**“On Novel Reading” (from The Guardian; or Youth’s Religious Instructor, 1820)**_:

-This article makes the argument that young people are particularly susceptible to believing everything they read simply because it appears in book format. In particular, this article argues that novels lead to corruption of the mind. In particular, the article describes an instance in which "A late 'Recorder,' notices the death of a young lady of 17, in Ohio, and observes—“this was a case of cool, premeditated suicide, occasioned by extreme sensibility, and romantic ideas, created by novel reading. She imagined herself ridiculed and slighted by a young gentleman, who had engaged her affections." However, while this article may appear shocking at first, similar viewpoints are held today about video games and whether or not they lead to violent tendencies. In fact, this article seemed almost similar to "Farewell etaoin shrdlu"s reluctance for technological advancement.


_**“Farewell etaoin shrdlu”
Carl Schlesinger and David Loeb Weiss,**_:

This film explores how a particular type of printing machine has, over time, been overcome and abandoned due to recent technological advancements. This film is a case study of what Borsuki describes in "The Book as Object" in which the author explains how writing technology evolves around a social context. While the printing machines in the film have lasted "almost a hundred years" they are slow and unsustainable given that they take up a lot of space and require a significant amount of time to operate. While there is something to be said about maintaining the traditional way of doings things, the fear of computers and technology, in general, ignores how technology not only makes work more efficient, but it also allows for human labor to be allocated to places that need it. Before computer-based printing, news was a slow process but now with technology, knowledge (an invaluable human resource) is available almost instantaneously.
