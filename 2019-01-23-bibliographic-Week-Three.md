_**Baxter's Procustes by Charles Chesnutt**_:

Baxter's Procustes is a story that satirizes Charles Chesnutt's real life attempt to join the Rowfant Club of Cleveland in 1899, and then denial due to his status as a black man. The story is about an author, Baxter, who decides to publish a rare book of poetry and auction off sealed copies to the members of the rare book club he belongs to. Once the members all receive their copies, each of them refuse to open the sealing because it would make the book less rare, so they all pretend to have read the book even though none of them have even seen it. At the end of the story, they discover that the book inside the sealing is actually blank. The story satirizes rare book collecting and makes the argument that a book no one will ever read is just as useful as a completely blank stack of paper. The story ends with the book club realizing that the blankness of the book makes it especially rare.



_**Robert Darnton, “What is the History of Books? Revisited”**_:

In this essay, Darnton addresses three questions that he urges book historian to consider: How do books come into being? How do they reach readers? What do readers make of them? Throughout the essay, Darnton illustrates several answers to each question, from the problems that printers had to confront to book piracy. His overall argument and his discussion of the importance scholars should place on the materiality of books reminds me both of Leah Price's discussion of the uses of books in Victorian Britain and Meredith McGill's discussion of printer's decisions in "Format." What I find most interesting in all three of these pieces, is that they provide compelling arguments for the history and scholarly research of books all without addressing the text of the book, itself. Darnton, in particular, addresses the type of argument that studying the materiality of a book can make when thinking about book history in a way that draws attention away from the experience of reading as an act that involves only the reader and the book to one that is much more networked.



_**Leah Price, “Introduction” and “Reader’s Block” from How to Do Things with Books in Victorian Britain**_:

This reading explores how the various uses of books have evolved over time and how the argument against the digital is often to use an exalted form of the printed book. However, as Price illustrates, books had many uses in Victorian Britain, from pie linings and butter wrappings to toilet paper. Price does this is argue that many novelists who wrote "classic" literature (like Bronte, Dickens, etc) would have argued that an ideal text is one that exists independent of its medium. As time has gone on and more and more people become literate, the handling of books (using the physicality of books for purposes such as wrapping food) has been replaced by a conflation of the physicality of a book with its text. This reading reminded me of Baxter's Procustes in which the actual written content of the book (or lack thereof) is trumped by the materiality of the book. At first, the characters are angered by the lack of written text, but they soon see the blank physical book as even more valuable and rare than if the book had had text, in the first place.



_**Johanna Drucker, “Preliminary 1. Histories of the Book and Literacy Technologies” and “Preliminary 2. Bibliographical Alterities”**_:

This piece focuses on how bibliographic history has perpetuated colonization and calls for a redefinition of what it means for something to be a book. The article gives argues that returning to colonial literature and encounters with native peoples can reconceptualize bibliographic studies and the concept of "literacy." The author suggest that to do this, we should shift our focus away from object-based study and towards one that centers literacy as a cultural phenomenon that can take many forms. The authors argument that literacy has always been considered from a western perspective reminded my of Borsuk's discussion of the development of writing styles and tools and in particular, Borsuk's discussion of South American khipu. Borsuk states that the "opacity of the khipu is a legacy of colonization," (Borsuk 32) and similarly to Drucker's discussion of native writing, I wonder what book history would look like, today, if entire systems of native writing and recording hadn't been tossed aside and considered "other."




_**Jessica Pressman, “The Aesthetic of Bookishness in Twenty-First Century Literature” **_:

In this article, Jessica Pressman explores the "aesthetic" of bookishness and how recent arguments about the death of print have infiltrated modern literature. In particular, Pressman argues that there has been a technological and cultural shift away from a "book-centered society" and it has effected the literature that has been produced as a result. As we have read in Drucker and Pressman, books have not always been historically freely available to all people and the way book history has been constructed has often left many people out of the equation. In order to adapt to changing technologies, readers and writers must find a happy middle ground between technology and the material book rather than approaching the problem as a binary
