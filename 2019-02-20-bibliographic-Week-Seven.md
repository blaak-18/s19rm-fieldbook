### Annotated Bib Week Seven

-

_**M. M. H., “A Ramble with Mrs. Grundy: A Visit to the Victoria Printing Press,” (1860)**_:

This selection is what I would almost call a narrative manifesto. It seems to be trying to promote the idea that compositing is a type of work that women were meant to do and does so in a style that is somewhere inbetween narrative fiction and manifesto. Two areas in particular really drew my interest. The first was the quote "the compositor's trade should be in the hands of women only" (271). I found myself wondering what the rationale is behind this statement? My initial thought is that most domestic tasks (baking, sewing, cleaning, etc) require a certain degree of meticulousness and since women are trained from a young age to complete repetitive and detailed tasks (in the case of sewing or knitting) this would make women the ideal people to do compositing work. However, what I found also interesting is the quote "but as women are not employed on this work at the Victoria Printing Press, and never ought to be employed at manual labor so severe" (271). I found this quote to be interesting because I couldn't help but to think about the fact that though this is written out of London, in America at the time, people were still actively enslaved and women were, in fact, doing severe manual labor. And even in London, would there not have been severe manual labor being done by factory workers? I'm interested in discussing some of the class dynamics in this piece as well as how this piece is upholding gender norms while advocating for change at the same time. The idea that women are *meant* to do compositor work but *shouldn't* do manual labor relies on that sort of "inherent difference between sexes" argument that I want us to problematize.


_**“The Victoria Press,” Illustrated London News (15 June 1861) **_:

Besides the positively *delightful* illustration of the dog featured on this page, this article is primarily an informative piece about the Victoria Press after its first year of opening. I found this quote particularly interesting: "in time these were joined by a few who had been trained by male relatives, but who could find no other outlet for their industry." I found myself wondering how common this might have been in other fields, where women were trained by male relatives in a trade they would not have been expected to participate in. I know that this was quite common in the case of women reading broadly (philosophy, history, languages, etc). I find myself wondering why is it that these male relatives trained these women when there would be no way for them to use these skills? And is this sort of a proliferation of separate-spheres ideology? Where women are trained in private but men are the ones who are able to use these skills in the public?


_**Emily Faithfull, “Women Compositors,” English Woman’s Journal (1861)**_:

In this article, I really appreciated the mapping out of expectations for women compositors versus male compositors. I was immediately reminded of our reading of Benjamin Franklin and I found myself wondering how the experience that is mapped out by Franklin is different from the picture that is painted in this reading. This article provides some pretty good information on apprenticeship terms, wages, and also what is expected for a woman to become a good printer. While the article makes it clear that expectations for a good printer are relatively the same for both men and women, I find myself still wondering if a woman has more at stake in joining this particular line of work than a man.


_**Sarah Werner, “Finding Women in the Printing Shop” (2014)**_:

This article traces through the printing history of one book in early modern England. I found the relationships that the author draws between these women and the text to be particularly fascinating considering how low literacy rates were for women in early modern England. In particular, this quote struck me: “In the course of this single book’s printing history, we’ve seen women in nearly all roles associated with making books: a woman wrote it, a woman published it, a woman speculated with it, and a woman printed it.” This quote struck me because it makes me think about how women have been systematically erased and barred from the history of most STEM fields even though women, such as Ada Lovelace, have been at their hearts. It makes me think about why I'm passionate about the work that I do.


_**Matthew G. Kirschenbaum, “Introduction: It Is Known” and “Word Processing as a Literary Subject” from Track Changes: a Literary History of Word Processing (2016)**_:

This chapter and introduction traces through the relationship that writers have to word processors, and writing technology in general. Kirschenbaum makes his argument by going through several examples of writers which I found to be quote helpful. This article reminded me a lot of  “Farewell etaoin shrdlu” in that it seems to focusing on an inherent fear and distrust of technology to produce "authentic" writing. It also reminded me of the reaction that many had to the women in Victoria Press: that having women in the print shop would meant that something would be inherently lost.

_**“Printing” vocational film (1947) and “Learning to Set Type” vocational film (1940s)**_

These vocational films each go through the different steps of setting type and printing. Though these films are quite dated, they are filmed in a style that is very similar to "Farewell etaoin shrdlu." What I found very interesting was this quote: "printing as a vocation attracts many young men and women because it offers real opportunities for steady work, good pay, and advancement." However, so many of the different positions in the print shop have "man" in the name and nearly all of the people shown in the films were men. I got the immediate sense that though these videos were attempting to be inclusive of gender, class, etc that this is a field predominantly meant for white men.


_**Ellen Gruber Garvey, “Introduction” from Writing with Scissors (2012)**_:

This introduction by Ellen Gruber Garvey explores the ways in which nineteenth century scrapbooking that was done by women and African Americans mimicked the practices of a newspaper editor. As newspapers became cheaper and cheaper to produce in the nineteenth century, so too grew the understanding that newspapers contain fragmented information. Because of this, as Garvey argues, people were able to take this fragmented information and construct new meaning from it in the form of scrapbooks. This reading was particularly interesting to think of from a gendered perspective because thinking about how scrapbooking is a way of circulating, logging, and contributing to a shared pool of communal knowledge is something that I think scholars should give more attention to when discussing domestic writing. Scrapbooking, and particularly scrapbooking of domestic writings, is a way of democratizing knowledge in a way that I think is very particular to that form of writing.
