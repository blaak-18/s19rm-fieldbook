### Lab Report Seven

_**Prompt:**_

Our readings this week focused on histories of circulation, including historical modes of remix and reuse. Though we read it weeks ago, we could include Ellen Gruber Garvey’s work on scrapbooks here, to think about nineteenth-century modes of (re)appropriation, collage, and/or juxtaposition. How do we make meaning out of cultural scraps, both literally and figuratively? How do cut-up works resonate for writers and readers? What are the roles of repetition and novelty within the textual systems—historical or contemporary—we have studied this week, or within those you study in your own work? Finally, what do we mean by circulation in these contexts, and how does studying the social, political, and technical systems of circulation help us better understand the texts that move through them?

_**Response**_:

This week, we worked on some building blocks for understanding the programming language, R, as well as worked on developing twitter bots. Since I'm pretty comfortable programming in Python, I was pleased to find that the logic of R and a lot of the syntax seemed very familiar when compared to some of my experiences going from Python to languages like C or Java. Thinking about circulation for this week in terms of Twitter bots, I think is a very useful way for thinking about how circulation functions in the digital age. While with a Twitter bot, the framework is familiar to the reader (for instance, an Edgar Allan Poe bot would come with content that would be somewhat familiar to a reader of the account) but what makes the bot resonate with people is how the different pieces come together to formulate something new that can't really be attributed to that original framework in  the same way. What makes Twitter bots so funny is not just the Tweets themselves, and not just the framework of the account, but that when both of those things come together, they generate some new meaning that is amusing because its working together.

The quote from Garvey's piece that resonates with me the most is that the makers of nineteenth century scrapbooks "collected , concentrated, and critiqued accounts from a press that they did not own, to tell their own stories in books they wrote with scissors" (4). Thinking about circulation, I think the example of the Twitter bot is particularly interesting because part of the success of a Twitter bot depends on the reader understanding the original "author" of the tweet. For instance, the text of a Twitter bot tweet from an Edgar Allan Poe bot is only funny if the reader understands that the tweet is supposedly being written by Edgar Allan Poe. If the tweet were to somehow circulate independently from the original account, it would lost most of its humor. In this way, I think that Twitter bots differ quite a bit from nineteenth century scrapbooks. A scrapbook might have bits and pieces from various different publications pasted together, but once those scraps have been curated into the scrapbook, in many ways, their original writer and their original publication doesn't really matter. The form of the scrapbook makes meaning possible independently of the original source. However, where both a Twitter bot and a scrapbook are very similar is that they can tell us a lot about what bits and pieces of different publications or dialogue resonates with people. I think that the Twitter bot is an interesting example of a way to tell how derivative an author can be from their text and still be able to recognize the text as belonging to the author. For example, with the Edgar Allan Poe bot, the tweet can have an random assortment of words, but as long as it has "quoth the raven" in it at some point, the text is somewhat familiar to the reader. Similarly, scrapbooks can tell us at what point of abstraction a publication can be deemed "useful" or recognizable to a reader. While both Twitter bots and scrapbooks work to generate new meaning out of an existing publication, they also tell us a lot about the parts of an original text "matter."
