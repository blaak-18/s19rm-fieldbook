### Lab Report Week Three
-

_**Prompt:**_

Your fieldbook entry should analyze salient similarities and differences among the pages in your three chosen books. Don’t simply list comparisons—though you might use bullet points to organize your thoughts—but work to understand significances. What can we learn from just a few page openings about relationships among technology, media, and culture during your texts’ periods? What do these books teach us about shifting reading, writing, and publishing practices? How does each set of pages signal what a book is, who a book is for, and what a book does during its historical period? What are the logics, codes, and protocols through which a “book” operates in each period? Can you trace an evolutionary path from earlier books in your set to latter ones?

In your lab report, you should link your thoughts and observations about these specific texts to our course readings, which can help you understand the features and effects I want you to attend to.

_**Response:**_

Texts consulted:

- Benjamin Franklin, Briefe von der Elektricität (1758)
- Buteo Delphinaticus, Bvteonis Delphinatici Opera Geometrica (1554)
- De Humani Corporis Fabrica (1543)

I chose to focus on these three books because while they are each focused on pretty different topics, they all are non-English texts that focus on some field of science. Looking at the frontispieces of each book, some of the stylistic differences become immediately noticeable. While the title pages of the Franklin and Delphinaticus are very plainly decorated and straight forward, the title page of the Vesalius is incredibly elaborate and features a fully colored woodcut illustration. Besides the fact that the Vesalius piece is a folio, the intricate detail of both the coloring and the illustrations make it apparent that this book would have been intended for somebody incredibly wealthy. The Delphinaticus and Franklin, on the other hand, have a much more pedestrian appearance and the size of the books, themselves, indicate that the intended reader (while still upper class) would not have been so luxurious. These observations made me think of our in class discussions of the use and applications of folios. The Vesalius piece is so elaborate and so large that it seems to almost be an ancient version of a "coffee table book." Additionally, thinking back to Meredith L. McGill's “Format” I thought a lot about the  editorial and publishing decisions that must have gone into producing these works. It is obvious just from looking at them that not only are the intended readers at the forefront of the printer's mind, but that the production of a book like the Vesalius would have been incredibly expensive.

I then proceeded to flip each of the books open to a typical, text-heavy page. The immediate observation that I made was that the Delphinaticus piece was not only incredibly image heavy, but plays with the actual format of the words, as well. The Franklin, while it does feature some illustrations, is yet again much more pedestrian and straightforward.

However, once again, the Vesalius has both of the other books beat if only for this page:

Of course, Vesalius is known for his elaborate illustrations, but besides the sheer detail that has gone into this image, the coloring is also incredible. One simply cannot look at this codex without getting the immediate sense that not only was its production incredibly expensive, but the amount of labor that must have gone into producing such a large and detailed book must have been insurmountable. My thoughts went to our in class discussions of paper production and the amount of human labor that goes into paper production. Additionally, because the Vesalius piece is hand painted, I thought of how much additional human labor must have gone into those details, as well. While the Delphinaticus piece features some illustrations, the black and white nature of them makes it apparent that this book would have been much easier to reproduce, and the Franklin piece even easier, still. The Franklin piece seems to me to be primarily for the purposes of educating the reader on the subject of electricity. The Delphnaticus, while still educational, seems to be intended for a slightly more upper class reader. And the Vesalius piece, while I'm sure this book was also *read* seems to be more of a symbol of status and power than a book.
