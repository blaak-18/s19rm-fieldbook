### Lab Report Number Six
-

_**Prompt:**_

In this final letterpress lab report, I want you to think about our work with type and the press in the context of our course’s ongoing discussions of media, book history, and technology. How does physically working with this historical technology change your view of the handpress period and its texts? Think back to the books we have looked at in the archives or in Prof. Cordell’s collections presented in class. How might your fuller, embodied understanding of how those books were created help you think about them anew? What new meanings might those media carry now that you better understand their means of production? Do the experiences of the past few weeks give you any new interpretive purchase when thinking about historical texts?

_**Response:**_

This week, I think what struck me the most about working with the press, itself, was just how physically demanding that job would have been in order to produce the sheer mass of publications that would have been demanded of any particular print shop. I think before working with the press, I hadn't ever really thought about the amount of labor that goes into publishing or printing a piece of writing. The amount of labor that must have gone into setting type and operating the heavy wheels of the press are such involved processes and this labor would have been repeated over and over again in order to produce work that people consider to be pretty pedestrian today such as a newspaper.

The closest thing that I could compare this experience to would be to compare it to the way that I think about website design. I think so many people take for granted webpages and programs that are so easily accessible and available on the internet. However, each of these pieces of technology were shaped and produced by invisible hands working behind the scenes to make that ease of access possible. In many ways, I think that successful printing technology (whether that be the printing press or a web design language) is one that makes you forget that someone had to put work into making it, but I also think that something is inherently lost when we allow ourselves to ignore and write off the labor of others. I will definitely take these thoughts forward when thinking about literary history and book history because I am always interested in discussions of labor and production. In particular, I'm interesting in thinking about questions such as whose labor do we see? Whose labor do we consider to be actual labor? It seems almost common sense to say that we consider the labor of the author of a text to be legitimate (we put their name on the text, after all), but is the labor of the printer visible? Is the labor of the paper maker visible?
