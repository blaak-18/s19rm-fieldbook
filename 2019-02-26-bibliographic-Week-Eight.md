### Annotated Bib Week Eight

-

_**William Blake, “The Tyger” and “London” (For each poem, compare at least 3 editions by clicking “Objects from the Same Matrix” below the page image).**_:

What I found most striking about each of these poems was how different some of the illustrations were across different editions. I'm not sure if these editions would have been hand painted, but I thought that some of the differences in coloring really sets up different tones for the poems. For example, the edition of "London" listed as Object 51 includes a lot of black, harsh lines that make the overall tone of the poem seem rather heavy while the frankly delicate coloring of the same poem listed as Object 47 gives it an almost whimsical feeling. While various editions of a text can differ quite a bit, I think that the differences in the illustrations are especially striking in these instances. Because for me, the differences in illustration seem to be setting up the tone of the poem, I found myself thinking back to Donald McKenzie's discussion of the social aspect of a text and it made me think about how these are all the same poem, but depending on which one you read, you might get something very different out of the text.


_**Donald F. McKenzie, “The Book as an Expressive Form” from Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts (orig. 1986)**_:

This chapter argues that traditional definitions of bibliography have been too "pure" and that bibliographers should really be concerned with how the form a text can generate meaning. Traditional definitions of bibliography have limited the text to only those that are printed on paper and take on traditional forms but since a text can take on many forms outside of these traditional methods, the definition of bibliography should also expand to include these forms, as well. In addition to pairing quite well with Ryan's article regarding dirty OCR and digital forms of texts, I think that this article makes an interesting argument when compared to Christopher Looby's article regarding serial texts. Texts that are published serially have a very different social function than texts that appear in manuscript form and thinking about how the form that a serial text takes on in a magazine or newspaper can deeply impact the reception of that text. I would say that inclusive definitions of bibliography are not only important, but are also an essential part of understanding how a text operates on a social level.

_**Ryan Cordell, “‘Q i-jtb the Raven’: Taking Dirty OCR Seriously” (2017)**_:

This article makes the argument that similarly to how different editions of a text in print can tell us a lot about print culture in the era of its creation, dirty-OCR can teach us a lot about the priorities and economics of the academy in today's time. As a result, digital copies of a text should be considered as new editions, subsidiary editions, and impressions of the original text. I found this article very interesting because I think a lot about the use of imperfect OCR and how mistakes that OCR can make with a text can tell us a lot about what OCR has been trained to identify correctly. I think in a lot of ways, dirty OCR can make the texture of a text more visible than traditional reading methods might allow for.
