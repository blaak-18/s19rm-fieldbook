### Annotated Bib Thirteen

-

_**Jon Bois, “What Football Will Look Like in the Future” (2017)**_:

This piece is so incredibly cool. I don't think I've ever reading a digital text that makes use of its medium quite like this piece does. What I found particularly interesting about this piece was that it was published serially, which makes me think back to nineteenth century serial publications in newspapers. One thing that I thought about while reading, however, is that since the story relies on the use of gifs and youtube videos, does that make the story less permanent somehow? If those videos get deleted, what happens to the story? Is this something we should be worried about at all? How would this change the mediation of the story for a reader?


_**Élika Ortega, “Not a Case of Words: Textual Environments and Multimateriality in Between Page and Screen (2017)**_:

This article examines the possibilities of form and interface that textual media can take. Ortega examines various forms of electronic literature to put forth an idea of "textual environment, a type of textual media that emerges out of a multimaterial configuration and which is becoming increasingly more common in electronic literature." I think that in  today's world, our definitions of literature and text must be expanded to include the possibilities and imaginaries of digital spaces. Specifically, I'm thinking about how stories aren't necessarily linear, front-to-cover experiences, anymore. And these evolutions are taking place even in video form as the "choose your own adventure" format for television becomes more popular. A lot of attention to texture and materiality in this reading reminds me of some of our earlier reading's  focus  on the materiality of page. I think that a lot of considerations and theory regarding the material nature of a book should be extended to digital spaces in order to more closely consider how the materiality of a digital space mediates a particular reading experience.


_**Amaranth Borsuk, “The Book as Idea” and “The Book as Interface” from The Book (2018)**_:

I was particularly drawn to the chapter "The Book as Interface" because I am very interested in this idea that electronic reading experiences attempt to collapse and make invisible the digital interface on which is it experienced. While I think in a lot of ways, a book cannot be boiled down to just its text and that the idea of making the interface of a text invisible in some way diminishes the experience of reading, I also think a lot about how these technologies that attempt to collapse the visibility of interface are used by people of various ability. However, I also think that interactive digital texts are so incredible in their limitless ability to guide a reading experience. Like in the Ortega piece, the consideration for the materiality of a digital space should be included in any digital rendering of a text, but the reader should also be given the choice to opt out of this mediation.

_**Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler, “Anatomy of an AI System: The Amazon Echo As An Anatomical Map of Human Labor” (2018)**_:

As a big user/fan of Alexa, I was drawn to this piece. I think one part of this piece that seemed to hurt the argument was the focus on convenience. I think something that a lot of people don't consider when thinking about Alexa is how, for people with physical disabilities or for older people who live alone, Alexa can help with tasks that might be difficult to accomplish. For example, the Echo Show has a video camera function that allows you "drop in" on someone else's Alexa that has been paired with it. This makes it easy to check in on elderly people who might live alone or might have difficulty paying for a nurse to care for them in their home. Don't get me wrong, Jeff Bezos is literally the worst, but the Amazon Echo is an important piece of technology that does a lot of good for a lot of people. This piece seems to be more a commentary on the limits of modern day capitalism than it seems to be specific to the Amazon Echo. I think most of the arguments in this piece could be applied to any modern corporation and I guess the big question is what types of human abuse are we willing to overlook? Does the knowledge that most of the clothes we wear are produced in sweatshops stop us from buying them? Does the knowledge that Google tracks our browsing history and sells our information to advertising companies stop us from using Google? I think that focusing on the cycle of abuse inherent in a device like the Echo doesn't get at the root of the problem which is much more insidious and much more difficult to parse out.
