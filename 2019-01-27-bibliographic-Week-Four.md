### Annotated Bib Week Four

-

_**Herman Melville, “The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids” in Herman Melville: the Dover Reader**_:

This story includes two sketches: one that portrays the upper class (paradise) and one that portrays the lower class (tartarus). Besides the obvious gendered reading of this piece (the unmarried women are resigned to hell and the unmarried men are in paradise) this piece also illustrates stark differences in class with the upper class characters (9 bachelors) are situated around a table at a dinner while the lower class women are laborers at a paper mill. this piece (besides the Marxist elements that are common to Melville's work) reminded me a lot of the piece we read last week discussing the uses of books in Victorian times. While the men are allowed to dine and discuss literature, the physicality of the book and the labor of manufacture is left to women.  


_**Bonnie Mak, “Architectures of the Page” from How the Page Matters (2012)**_:

In this reading, Bonnie Mak explores the architecture of the page throughout history, illustrating the overlapping methods and means for arranging the page as well as how different strategies for arranging text have developed. In particular, I found Mak's discussion of blankness on the page to be fascinating. Understanding blankness as a visual and cognitive break made me think about how marbled pages or black pages or visualizations function in texts like _Tristram Shandy_ that play with the idea of book and page. This article made me think about our discussion of format from earlier weeks, and in particular, Meredith McGill's discussion of printer/publisher's decisions.


_**Jonathan Senchyne, “Paper Nationalism: Material Textuality and Communal Affiliation in Early America” (2017)**_:

In this essay, Senchyne assembles a selection of texts from the 17th-19th centuries that discuss paper in order to explore an idea he calls "paper nationalism." He defines paper nationalism as a way of thinking about how paper, regardless of what is written on it, can shape communal and political affiliation. This essay reminded me of Senchyne's other essay on capitalism because of its focus on the anxieties that historically have surrounded paper. In particular, Senchyne's discussion of "performative paper," or paper that constitutes the state or identity (in the case of "undocumented" persons, etc) reminded me of his similar discussion of how paper money performs and embodies the system of capitalism.

_**Jonathan Senchyne, “Rags Make Paper, Paper Makes Money: Material Texts and Metaphors of Capital” (2017)**_:

In this article, Senchyne discusses the relationship between rag paper and capitalism (paper from rags and money from paper). Senchyne argues that the transformation of rags to money illustrates how capitalism seemingly developed from nothing and how value is arbitrarily assigned to money due in part to its materiality. This article made me wonder, if part of the anxiety of paper money is that its only backed by its materiality, then how does cryptocurrency like BitCoin factor into this anxiety? Does a type of currency that is backed by nothing illustrate even more clearly how arbitrarily capitalism assigns value?
