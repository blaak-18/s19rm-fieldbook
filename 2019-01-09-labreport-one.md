### Lab Report Week One
-

_**Prompt:**_
Your first lab report has a wide mandate, and will give you the chance to experiment with weaving together your ideas from our first weekâ€™s reading and discussion with a thoughtful engagement with our first laboratory. Do not try to discuss every reading or point you might; instead, choose 1-2 readings and one central idea to dig into. Use your lab report to bring together theory and praxis, to begin understand doing as a critical and intellectual practice intimately related to thinking or writing. In this case, what might Markdown have to say to our burgeoning understanding of media and materiality?

-

_**Response:**_

This week, we delved into understanding what it means to analyze a book as a material object and ways in which languages such as Markdown can lend that same attention to and sense of materiality to digital texts. The file that we produced together as a class was a "test" file which most includes examples of different formatting choices that one can make in Markdown such as *italics* or **bold** text. The majority of that file is included below:

Markdown has a way of making writers focus on the materiality of their work in instances where it might not matter as much. Rather than leave the form to an editor or to an imagined reader, markdown allows the writer and the text to speak for itself. Similarly to how one might look at a physical book and be able to make note of its many characteristics all without delving into the content, Markdown allows for the  materiality of digital text to become a focal point for the writer. It doesn't matter so much that what I am saying, but it does matter that I can

*do this* or

 _**this**_ or
### this.


As Marshall McLuhan argues in *The Medium is the Message*, "the 'content' of any medium is always another medium" (MuLuhan 8). Writing, itself, is speech made material and the materiality of text is "the content of print" (MuLuhan 8). Markdown makes this relationship especially visible by making the author a participant in the materiality of the text rather than just a perpetuator of speech. Often, we think of 'authors' as creators of written works, but that relationship is actually exaggerated. The author is the creator of the content of the book, as far as the actual words go, but they are not the creator of the book in its physicality. In Markdown, this relationship is made less distinct and the power of the texture of words and physicality is handed more fully over to the author. In this situation, the author is both the writer of the text and the creator of the object.
