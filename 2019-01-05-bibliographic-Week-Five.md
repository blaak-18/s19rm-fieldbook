### Annotated Bib Week Five

-

_**Benjamin Franklin, The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, Chapters 2-7**_:

The selection from Franklin's autobiography that we read details his experiences working as an apprentice to his older brother, James, who was a printer. Along the way, Franklin informs us of various episodes in his life from his father discouraging him from pursuing poetry to a brief stint of vegetarianism that was inspired by something he read. Eventually, Franklin quits working for his brother and seeks work elsewhere. I was most surprised both by the variety of things that Franklin describes himself reading (I honestly didn't even know that vegetarianism was a thing in the 1700s) and by the fact that there had only been 2 newspapers in America at this point of his life. I think this fact makes the pure number of newspapers that become available in the nineteenth century very striking.


_**Lisa Gitelman, “Print Culture (Other Than Codex): Job Printing and Its Importance” **_:

In this article, Gitelman argues that "print culture" has long been considered only in terms of the codex, but that printing, in general encapsulates many other forms of printing. She argues that print culture should embrace "the customs and practices that evolved within Western printing establishments"(Gitelman 186), or in other words, return to the print shop. She then moves through the example of job printing, explaining that most of output of job printing did not lead to publication and therefore did not enter the public sphere which means that they can't be considered in the traditional sense that books are. Gitelman's discussion of the function of these non-public documents reminded me of Jonathan Senchyne's discussion of paper nationalism. I think both authors are making similar arguments about the function of paper and printer versus reader.  


_**Amaranth Borsuk, “The Book as Content”**_:

Similarly to the first chapter that we read from Borsuk, this chapter blew my mind. Borsuk begins by explaining that with the rise in silent readership, the desire for personal copies of books rose which lead to eventual invention of the printing press. For similar reasons, books were also produced in varying sizes since smaller books were both more portable and more "intimate." However, since books were so easy to print, there also came a whole class of issues surrounding copyright in the nineteenth century. Borsuk concludes the chapter with a statement regarding how twenty-first century modes of book production and movement towards e-readers has encouraged a disconnect between the book as an object and the book as content. This chapter, in particular, reminded me of our time in the archive and the level of artistry that is present in some of the books that we looked at. While I am very pro-e-readers, I sometimes wonder what is being lost in this great migration to digital reading.

_**Marcy J. Dinius, “Press”**_:

In this article, Dinius examines different historical and politically tense instances in which the printing press has been targeted as an agent of change. In particular, this article hones in on the relationship between print and race. In the case of abolitionist printing presses being destroyed and the personified, Dinius argues that this personification is problematized by the fact that white Americans were willing to consider a machine to be more human/worthy of humanity than a slave. However, print was also weaponized at the time, wielded by abolitionists and African Americans as a way of penetrating the South. Ultimately, Dinius argues, it was the combination of violence and the force of print that ended slavery. What struck me about this piece is that having just finished Franklin's Autobiography where Franklin writes about the existence of only two American newspapers, that in relatively little time, newspapers, and print in general, could be so thoroughly weaponized.

_**Ann Blair, “Introduction” from Too Much To Know**_:

In this introduction to her book-length study, Ann Blair posits that the assumption that we are currently living in the "information age" is incorrect. She argues this by using the example of the reference book, an early modern text that not only served to compile information, but engaged its readers in "information management" well before the term had even been coined, showing that anxieties of information overload are not unique to our era. Oddly, this piece made me think of your comments on my lab report regarding the materiality of the programming language Python. I think we like to think of humanity as something that existed in a vacuum before the invention of the internet but in a way, its oddly reassuring that humans had seemingly always grappled with anxieties of information.
