### Lab Report Week Five
-

_**Prompt:**_

Let’s leave the response for today open, but keep a particular eye on the week’s readings and ways you can connect our ongoing work with type to those historical and literary touchstones.

_**Response:**_

This week, we were responsible for setting the type of something that we've selected for ourselves. For this week, I decided to set the first verse of Song of Myself by Walt Whitman since its my favorite poem. I think what stood out to me the most about this lab was that I had to pay attention to the spelling of the words and the spacing more than I feel like I have before. The actual setting of the type I found very difficult because I  found myself forgetting which direction that the type had to be set or how to put the type in the galley without everything falling over. I found myself thinking about how frustrating setting type would have been in a time when light would have been low or the deadline would have been more extreme. Especially, setting type in a situation where there were several pages that needed to be set or with a deadline that absolutely had to be met I felt would have been impossible.

Considering this lab with our readings in mind, I kept thinking about our readings regarding the Victoria Press and how some women were trained in a printing press, but weren't allowed to actually work in the press. While setting the type was difficult because I'd never done it before, I found myself wondering why it was, in particular, that women were barred from working in the presses. In some ways, I could understand how operating a printing press might have been considered too physically demanding for women to people in that particular point in history, I don't quite understand what it is about setting type that seemed to be gender-based work. This lab really illustrated for me how arbitrary gender lines can be and how even things that I find to be pedestrian or common today was forbidden for women. In a way, I set type every day using my keyboard and laptop, but not too long ago, women wouldn't have been allowed to do so.
