_**Ellen Gruber Garvey, “Anonymity, Authorship, and Recirculation: A Civil War Episode” (2006)**_:

This article traces through the function of authorship and recirculation in nineteenth century America. While this article focuses on a particular instance during the Civil War, one quote that really struck me was near the beginning of the article. Garvey writes that "from newspapers, readers added a layer of domestic circulation by clipping and saving items for their scrapbooks to create home-made anthologies" (160). I find this quote particularly interesting because I am very interested in writing and circulation within the domestic sphere. In particular, I'm thinking about how so many women would write and create recipe books by saving and scrapbooking clippings from newspapers that had recipes or domestic advice on them. Considering scrapbooks as a form of localized circulation I think really says a lot about what resonated with women in the domestic sphere and which pieces from newspapers they found work anthologizing. Considering something like a recipe book as a domestic anthology really illustrates a communal/communicative relationship that I think is different from other forms of circulation.


_**Jim Ridolfo and Dànielle Nicole DeVoss, “Composing for Recomposition: Rhetorical Velocity and Delivery” (2009)**_:

In this webtext, the authors discuss a concept that call "composing for strategic recomposition," or situations in which composers anticipate that their work will be rewritten in some way. I found the section on "remixing" to be particularly fascinating. The authors define remixing as "the process	of taking old pieces of text, images, sounds, and video and stitching	them together to form a new product," and I found this concept to be very interesting when thinking about the role that remixing plays in the tech world. In many ways, the popularity of websites like Github by programmers shows a sort of consideration for recomposition that the authors of this webtext discuss. The ability for people to fork off of a piece of code or to take that code and put some new spin on it requires that the original poster anticipate that their work will be transformed for other users. In many ways, I think that the entire field of computer science is dependent on remix culture.


_**Meredith McGill, “A Matter of the Text” from American Literature and the Culture of Reprinting, 1834-1853 (2007)**_:

This introduction outlines the culture of reprinting in mid-nineteenth century America. The hallmark of the literary marketplace of the time was its decentralization, or its distribution across only mildly affiliated locations and it was this very decentralization that shaped literary culture. This article made me think about some research that I have been doing for another class in regards to antebellum America's economy. In addition to books circulating, antebellum cities (many of which McGill lists such as Philadelphia) were centers for secondhand trade. The economy of antebellum America was shaped by visible hands moving commodities from person to person and across state lines. In particular, I enjoyed McGill's insistence on using "reprinting" rather than "piracy" since the practice of reprinting was perfectly legal in the time. I think that this introduction really illustrates just how dependent the antebellum economy was on secondhand trade and how that influenced what types of things people were reading.


_**Ryan Cordell and Abby Mullen, “‘Fugitive Verses’: The Circulation of Poems in Nineteenth-Century American Newspapers” (2017). Also Read “Beautiful Snow” and 2 other verses of your choosing from Fugitive Verses, looking at the example poems at the example newspaper printing linked at the top of each.**_:

This article explores the ways in which "fugitive verses," a nineteenth century term used to describe poems that couldn't be attributed to one author in particular, can be used as a framework for understanding the fluidity of authorship in nineteenth century American newspaper poetry. I found the example of "The Children" to be intriguing since the debate of the time seemed to be whether the poem was written by Charles Dickenson, a lawyer, or Charles Dickens, the famous writer. This example is interesting because it brings to light questions about how the narrative surrounding authorship can often circulate independently from the poem, itself. Does what we think about Charles Dickens change if he had written "The Children"? Does what we think about the poem "The Children" change if we think it was written by Charles Dickens? Are these questions intertwined or can (and were they) understood to be separate?
